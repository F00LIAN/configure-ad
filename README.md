<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines<br />

<h1>Familiar Use Case</h1>
You go to a university and you can log into any computer on campus with the same username and password. This is because all of those computers are joined to the Active Directory "Domain".<br />

<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: How to Deploy on-premises Active Directory within Azure Compute](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

1. Create Azure Resources

    - Create a dedicated Resource Group (e.g., "active-directory-lab")

    - Create a Virtual Network (e.g., "active-directory-vnet") in your preferred region (East US)

    - Provision two Azure Virtual Machines:
        1. DC-1: Windows Server 2022 (to be the Domain Controller)
        2. Client-1: Windows 10 (to be the domain-joined client)
  
2. Configure Network and Firewall Settings

    - Set a Static Private IP address for the Domain Controller’s Network Interface
    
    - Disable the Windows Firewall on the Domain Controller (for lab/demonstration purposes)
    
    - On Client-1, change the DNS server to point to the Domain Controller’s private IP address

3. Install and Configure Active Directory Domain Services

    - Install the "Active Directory Domain Services" server role on DC-1
    
    - Promote DC-1 to a Domain Controller and create a new forest (e.g., mydomain.com)
    
    - Restart DC-1 and log in to the new domain (e.g., mydomain.com\labuser)

4. Join the Client to the Domain and Manage Objects

    - Create a Domain Admin user (e.g., jane_admin) and assign Domain Admins membership
    
    - Join Client-1 to the new domain (mydomain.com)
    
    - Use PowerShell to create additional users in bulk
    
    - Configure Account Lockout, enable/disable accounts, and observe security logs for user events

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

### 1. Create Resource Group and Virtual Network

</p>
<p>

- Create a Windows 10 virtual machine in Microsoft Azure.
  
- Use a dedicated resource group "active-directory-lab" for connection purposes.

- Create a virtual network under the new resource group and call it "active-directory-vnet" under East US.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>

- Create a Windows 10 virtual machine in Microsoft Azure, call it "DC-1" under East US.
  
- Make sure to use the dedicated resource group "active-directory-lab".

- For image use "Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition". Make sure to enable licensing and RDP/SSH.

- Under Networking make sure to select the Active-Directory-Vnet we created. Then Create.

- Press Windows Key + R, type gpmc.msc to open the Group Policy Management Console.
  - Edit the Default Domain Policy → Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Account Policies → Account Lockout Policy.
  - Set:
      - Account lockout duration: 30 minutes
      - Account lockout threshold: 5 invalid attempts

- On Client-1, attempt to log in with the chosen user and deliberately enter the wrong password multiple times to lock the account.

<p>
  
- On DC-1, press Windows Key + R, type eventvwr.msc to open Event Viewer.
  - Go to Windows Logs → Security → Search for events related to the chosen user.

- On Client-1, you can also open Event Viewer to observe successful or failed login attempts from the local perspective.
</p>
<br />

### 12. Conclusion
You have successfully deployed a basic on-premises style Active Directory lab inside Azure, created domain administrator and standard user accounts, joined a Windows 10 client to the domain, and tested various Active Directory features such as account lockout policies, enabling/disabling accounts, and examining security logs.

<h2>Next Steps for Exploring Active Directory Further</h2>

1. Advanced Group Policy
    - Configure specific Group Policies for software deployment, folder redirection, or workstation security settings.
    - Explore creating and linking multiple GPOs to different Organizational Units.

2. DNS and DHCP Integration
    - Set up DHCP on your Domain Controller or another server to manage IP addressing in a more dynamic environment.
    - Explore advanced DNS configurations, like conditional forwarders and DNS zone replication.

3. Replication and Sites
    - Experiment with adding another Domain Controller in a different Azure region or on-premises location.
    - Configure Sites and Subnets in Active Directory to optimize replication.

4. Certificate Services
    - Install and configure Active Directory Certificate Services to issue certificates for users and machines.
    - Explore how certificates can secure RDP sessions, web servers, or wireless networks.

5. Multi-Domain / Multi-Forest Environments
    - Investigate creating multiple domains and establishing trust relationships.
    - Understand forest-level trusts and how to delegate administration across multiple domains.

6. Automation and Scripting
    - Delve deeper into PowerShell scripting to automate account creation, group membership management, and reporting.
